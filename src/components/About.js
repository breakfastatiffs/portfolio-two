            <p className='body-p'>My names Tiffany Summerford and I'm a full-stack engineer from the Greater Boston area. 
                As a retired bartender with a "minor in marketing", I hold the skills to communicate effectively with a team, the creativity to design apps and the wit to absolve problems quickly. 
                Working in restaurants taught me a lot about how the world works and I account that experience to why I am the way I am. 
                Iâ€™ve always been more interested in working the front end of things, but I believe having an understanding of the entire house is key. 
                Hence my interest and education as a full-stack developer. If you're intersted in learning more about me, let's video chat over some hot coffee.
