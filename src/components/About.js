            <p>I'm a software developer from the Greater Boston Area who has a passion for the arts and betterment of humanity! As Gandhi once said, "You must be the change you want to see in the world." - so I am ever-consciously making an effort to improve myself: Mentally, emotionally, and physically. As a person who is constantly evolving, choosing a career that's doing the same thing makes the most sense.</p>
            <p>My interest in coding started as a kid when Myspace was still popular. I liked playing around with the aesthetics of my profile and figuring out how to make it more appealing. I've always been a creative person and even studied fashion for a little bit. I still love fashion, but I am less interested in a materialistic field and more interested in working with others who share the common goal of wanting to make the world a better place</p>
