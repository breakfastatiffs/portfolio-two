            <p>My names Tiffany Summerford and I'm a full-stack engineer from the Greater Boston Area. As a retired bartender with a minor in marketing, I hold the skills to communicate effectively with a team, the creativity to design apps and the wit to absolve problems quickly. Working in restaurants taught me a lot about how the world works and I account that experience to why I am the way I am. Iâ€™ve always been more interested in working the front end of things, but I believe having an understanding of the entire house is key. Hence my interest and education as a full-stack developer.</p>
